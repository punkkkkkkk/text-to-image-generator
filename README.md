# Text To Image Genrator

This project shows how to generate images from text descriptions using the Stable Diffusion model. The implementation is designed to run in **Google Colab** for easy setup and execution. The following images are genrated using 2nd Project



                                    WORKS IN GOOGLE COLAB ONLY 

                         ### IF TRIED TO RUN LOCALLY IT'LL TAKE TOO LONG ###


                            
### THERE'RE ARE 2 PROJECTS, 1ST IS FAST AND RELIABLE WHEREAS 2ND IS HIGHLY DETAILED ####

## Running the Code


- Open Google Colab.
- Click on "Upload" in the "Welcome to Colaboratory" panel or go to File > upload notebook.
- Upload the .ipynb notebook file.

## Notes

- Ensure you select a GPU runtime in Colab for faster image generation. Go to **Runtime** > **Change runtime type** and select **GPU**.
- If you encounter any issues, double-check that the packages are installed and the runtime is configured correctly.

# 1st PROJECT


## Project Overview

This project uses Stable Diffusion, a powerful text-to-image generation model, to create images from text descriptions. The model, developed by CompVis and made easily accessible through Hugging Faceâ€™s diffusers library, is capable of generating high-quality, detailed images based on user-provided prompts. The implementation is designed to run efficiently in Google Colab, where you can leverage the power of GPUs for faster performance.

## How It Works

1) Text Prompt Input: The user provides a text prompt that describes the image they want to generate.

2) Stable Diffusion Model: The StableDiffusionPipeline from the diffusers library processes the text input and generates an image. The model uses a process called latent diffusion to iteratively create an image that matches the given description.

3) Image Display: The generated image is displayed using matplotlib for easy visualization in the Colab notebook.

The process involves deep learning techniques that use pre-trained neural networks to transform textual information into visual content, relying heavily on GPU acceleration for efficient computation.




# 2nd PROJECT

## Project Overview

This project uses Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), a more advanced version of the Stable Diffusion model, for generating high-quality images from text descriptions. The implementation employs two main stages to create refined images: an initial generation step and a refinement step, leveraging models provided by Stability AI. The code is optimized for running in Google Colab, taking advantage of GPU acceleration to speed up the generation process. It uses the diffusers library from Hugging Face, which provides convenient tools for working with diffusion models, along with the transformers and accelerate libraries for efficient model execution.

## How It Works

1. Setup and Libraries
   
The project starts by installing necessary libraries: diffusers, transformers, and accelerate. These libraries streamline the process of loading and running the models efficiently.
Warnings from the libraries are suppressed for a cleaner output using Python's warnings module.

2. Loading the Models

Base Model: The Stable Diffusion XL Base Model generates an initial image from a text prompt. It is loaded using the DiffusionPipeline class and set to run on the GPU (cuda).
Refiner Model: The SDXL Refiner Model enhances the initial image to produce more refined and detailed results. It shares some components (e.g., the text encoder and VAE) with the base model to optimize performance.

3. Image Generation Process

The generate() function takes a text prompt as input and follows a two-step process:
Initial Image Generation: The base model generates a preliminary image using the given text prompt, with a specified number of inference steps (n_steps) and noise settings (high_noise_frac) to control the generation process.

Image Refinement: The refiner model improves the initial image, making it more detailed and visually appealing.
The final image is then displayed directly in the Colab notebook using IPython.display.

4. User Interaction Loop
   
The code includes a loop that allows users to input text prompts continuously to generate images. Users can type 'q' to quit the loop.
The process is interactive, making it suitable for experimentation and creativity.


# CRASH PROTECTION

if program crashes while importing diffusers run this code on top and try to re run the colab notebook again 

```python
# Reinstall protobuf and other necessary packages
!pip uninstall -y protobuf
!pip install protobuf

# Reinstall TensorFlow (if relevant)
!pip install --upgrade tensorflow

# Clear protobuf cache (if needed)
import shutil
shutil.rmtree('/root/.cache/protobuf', ignore_errors=True)
